# Introduction-to-self-driving-car-nanodegree

##### **This is a repository documenting my work on the Udacity Nanodegree (Introduction to Self Driving Cars).**

* Matrix manipulation: Implemented a matrix class to perform various matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, inverse, transpose, determinant). 

* 2-D Histogram filter: Localization of robot in a grid system using histogram filter in C++.

* Route planner using A star algorithm: Created a Google maps style routing algorithm using A star search.
