# Introduction-to-self-driving-car-nanodegree

###### This a repository documenting my work on the Udacity Nanodegree (Introduction to Self Driving Cars).

* Matrix manipulation: Implemented a matrix class to perform various matrix operations(addition,subtraction,multiplication,inverse,transpose,determinant). 

* 2-D Histogram filter: Created a two dimensional filter in C++.

* Route planner using A star algorithm: Created a Google maps style routing algorithm using A star search.
